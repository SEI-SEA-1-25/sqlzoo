# The wonderful world of sqlzoo
https://sqlzoo.net/ is a great resource for learning sql in a rapid-feedback environment. You will be going on a guided tour of it! 

### What you need to know, when you need to know it
On Wednesday, we will be assuming you have the knowledge up to and including segment 12. Also on Wednesday, we will be covering the material needed for segments 13 - 14 in class, and you will do 13 - 14 as part of your deliverable. If you finish 13 & 14 on Tuesday night, you will be ahead of the game on Wednesday and you will save yourself some homework on Wednesday.

### Some general notes about sqlzoo:
1. Each segment has a tutorial followed by a quiz.
1. We will not be doing all segments, and we will be skipping some questions within certain segments. Pay attention to the guided walkthrough!
1. Many questions have a link to helpful information, or a video that explains the solution. You should look at these before attempting the questions!
1. On every tutorial, you can append `?answers=true` onto the end of the url to see the answers. This is a helpful resource when you're completely stuck, but if you use it to turn this interactive learning experience into a read-along, you're not going to retain much!

### The segments:
Segments 1 - 5 will make you awesome at SELECT basics by giving you a lot of repetitions.

Segment 6 is somewhat out of order. It relies on aggregates and nested queries, which are covered in segments 7 - 10. You can come back and do this quiz after finishing segement 10.

Do segment 7 only up through question 5. As the site says, the rest of the questions are more than we need.
