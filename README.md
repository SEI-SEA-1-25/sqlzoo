# The wonderful world of sqlzoo
https://sqlzoo.net/ is a great resource for learning sql in a rapid-feedback environment. You will be going on a guided tour of it! 

### Getting started, and eventually, turning it in
Fork and clone this repo. Your deliverable will be a screenshot of the last question you got to, similarly to when we did CSS games. Put the screenshot into this folder, and add-commit-push it just like any other file.

### Some general notes about sqlzoo:
1. Each segment has a tutorial followed by a quiz.
1. We will not be doing all segments, and we will be skipping some questions within certain segments. Pay attention to the guided wathrough!
1. Many questions have a link to helpful information, or a video that explains the solution. You should look at these before attempting the questions!
1. On every tutorial, you can append `?answers=true` onto the end of the url to see the answers. This is a helpful resource when you're completely stuck, but if you use it to turn this interactive learning experience into a read-along, you're not going to retain much!

### The segments:
Segments 1 - 5 will make you a champion at SELECT basics by giving you a lot of repetitions.
1. [`https://sqlzoo.net/wiki/SELECT_basics`](https://sqlzoo.net/wiki/SELECT_basics)
2. [`https://sqlzoo.net/wiki/SELECT_Quiz`](https://sqlzoo.net/wiki/SELECT_Quiz)
3. [`https://sqlzoo.net/wiki/SELECT_from_WORLD_Tutorial`](https://sqlzoo.net/wiki/SELECT_from_WORLD_Tutorial)

5. [`https://sqlzoo.net/wiki/SELECT_from_Nobel_Tutorial`](https://sqlzoo.net/wiki/SELECT_from_Nobel_Tutorial)

Segment 6 is somewhat out of order. It relies on aggregates and nested queries, which are covered in segments 7 - 10. You can come back and do this quiz after finishing segement 10.

6. [`https://sqlzoo.net/wiki/Nobel_Quiz`](https://sqlzoo.net/wiki/Nobel_Quiz)

Do segment 7 only up through question 5. As the site says, the rest of the questions are more than we need.
7. [`https://sqlzoo.net/wiki/SELECT_within_SELECT_Tutorial`](https://sqlzoo.net/wiki/SELECT_within_SELECT_Tutorial)

For segment 8, only do questions number 4, 5, and 6.
